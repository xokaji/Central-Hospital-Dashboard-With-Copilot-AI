Central Hospital Data Insights Dashboard

Mission
The Central Hospital Data Insights Dashboard is a locally deployable analytics platform designed to help hospital management monitor operational efficiency, clinical performance, financial health, and patient risk — all without requiring heavy IT infrastructure investment.

The system runs on existing hospital servers using lightweight Python-based tools and provides real-time insights to support data-driven decision-making.

Problem Addressed

The hospital manages a high volume of inpatient and OPD cases but lacks an integrated intelligence system to:

Monitor occupancy and ICU utilization trends

Evaluate treatment effectiveness

Track cost and departmental workload

Identify high-risk patients likely to be readmitted

Additionally, the finance department prefers a solution that avoids expensive cloud infrastructure.

Proposed Solution

The platform follows a streamlined local-first architecture:

Data Integration
Structured EHR tables, semi-structured logs, and clinical notes are consolidated into a unified dataset.

Data Enrichment & KPI Generation
Patient records are processed to calculate:

Bed occupancy rate

ICU utilization rate

Average length of stay

Readmission rate

Department-level workload

Treatment cost trends

Predictive Analytics Layer
A lightweight machine learning model predicts:

Probability of 30-day readmission

High-risk patient classification

This enables early intervention and improved care planning.

Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)
A single-page dashboard visualizes:

Operational KPIs

Clinical performance indicators

Financial trends

High-risk patient roster

Weekly admission and cost patterns

Decision-makers can adjust risk thresholds and instantly see updated high-risk patient lists.

Key Benefits

✔ Runs on existing hospital servers
✔ No mandatory cloud costs
✔ Improves resource allocation
✔ Supports early risk detection
✔ Enables data-driven treatment policy improvements
✔ Modular and future-ready for advanced AI upgrades

Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered pipeline:

Data Sources → Processing & KPI Generation → Predictive Model → Dashboard Visualization

📌 Include a system architecture diagram here (one clean layered diagram showing inputs, processing, model, and dashboard).
This improves clarity and professionalism while keeping the document concise.

Conclusion

This solution provides Central Hospital with a cost-efficient, scalable, and intelligent data insights platform that enhances operational visibility, clinical decision support, and patient risk management — without significant infrastructure expansion.
