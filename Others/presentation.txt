🧑‍💼 Speaker 1 (3 Minutes)
🎯 Problem, Context & Objectives
Slide 1 – Title Slide

Central Hospital Data Insights Platform
AI-Driven Operational & Predictive Dashboard

Short intro:

“Hospitals generate massive amounts of data daily, but much of it remains underutilized for decision-making.”

Slide 2 – Problem Statement

Explain clearly:

5000 patient capacity

High OPD + inpatient volume

Data exists but is not fully mined

No integrated predictive system

Finance department doesn’t want heavy IT investment

Say:

“The hospital has data, but lacks intelligence.”

Slide 3 – Objectives

Our system aims to:

Monitor operational KPIs

Improve treatment oversight

Predict readmission risks

Optimize cost and resource allocation

Avoid expensive infrastructure upgrades

Finish with:

“We focused on intelligence without infrastructure burden.”

🧑‍💻 Speaker 2 (3–4 Minutes)
🏗 Architecture & System Design
Slide 4 – Architecture Diagram (Very Important)

Show your clean layered diagram.

Explain in simple flow:

Data Sources
→ Processing
→ KPI Calculation
→ Predictive Model
→ Dashboard

Don’t go too technical.

Say:

“The system runs locally on hospital servers to ensure cost efficiency and data privacy.”

Slide 5 – Data & Processing

Explain:

Structured EHR tables

Semi-structured logs

Clinical notes

Data enrichment

KPI generation

Focus on business meaning:

Length of stay

ICU load

Department workload

Cost per patient

Slide 6 – Predictive Model

Explain:

Machine learning model predicts readmission probability

Outputs risk score + classification

Helps identify high-risk patients early

Important sentence:

“Instead of reacting to readmissions, the hospital can proactively intervene.”

Keep it impact-focused.

📊 Dashboard & Impact
Slide 7 – Dashboard Overview

Show screenshots.

Explain sections:

Operational KPIs

Clinical metrics

Financial trends

High-risk patient roster

Mention risk threshold slider.

Slide 8 – Example Insight

Give one scenario:

Example:

“If ICU occupancy increases above 85%, management can reallocate staff.”

OR

“If a patient shows high readmission risk, early monitoring can reduce complications.”

Make it real-world.

Slide 9 – Benefits & Value

Bullet clearly:

✔ Cost-efficient
✔ Local deployment
✔ Scalable
✔ Data-driven policy improvement
✔ Early risk detection

Slide 10 – Conclusion

Strong ending:

“Our solution transforms hospital data into actionable intelligence while respecting financial and infrastructure constraints.”
