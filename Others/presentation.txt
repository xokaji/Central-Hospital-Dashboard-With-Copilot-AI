Pupil 1: Context & Vision (2 Minutes)

Goal: Set the stage, define the problem, and establish the "Local-First" philosophy.

    The Hook: "Good morning. We’re looking at Central Hospital—a massive 5,000-bed facility. Right now, its data is a sleeping giant. We have the scale, but we lack the 'connective tissue' to turn raw numbers into life-saving insights without a multi-million dollar IT overhaul."

    The Vision: "Our goal was to create a unified 'Command Center.' Usually, finance, clinical quality, and operations live in separate silos. We’ve merged them into a single system that doesn’t just report on the past but predicts the future."

    The Data Landscape: "We’re handling a complex mix: structured patient tables, JSON system logs, and metadata from clinical notes. Crucially, we’ve designed this to stay local. By processing data within the hospital’s own environment, we bypass the privacy hurdles and high costs of cloud-heavy setups while maintaining total data sovereignty."

Pupil 2: Architecture & Pipeline (3 Minutes)

Goal: Explain the "engine room" and the predictive power of the LTM.

    The Pipeline: "To make Pupil 1’s vision a reality, we built a robust automated pipeline. It starts with data ingestion and generation, followed by a rigorous preprocessing stage where we calculate our core KPIs. We don't just dump data; we transform it into 'Export Artifacts'—clean CSV and JSON files stored in data/processed/ that track departmental performance and weekly trends."

    The Predictive Engine (LTM): "The 'brain' of our project is our Long-Term Model: a HistGradientBoostingClassifier. We chose this because it excels at handling the tabular data common in healthcare. It’s trained on engineered features to calculate readmission probabilities. This isn't just a static report; it's a forward-looking tool that flags which patients are most likely to return before they even leave."

    Execution: "The entire flow is streamlined. With one command—python -m src.pipeline.run_pipeline—the system ingests, trains, predicts, and exports. It’s sophisticated engineering hidden behind a very simple 'start' button."

Pupil 3: Dashboard & Impact (3 Minutes)

Goal: Demonstrate the user experience and the "So What?" of the project.

    The Dashboard Walkthrough: "If Pupil 2 built the engine, I’m showing you the cockpit. Our Streamlit dashboard opens with a high-level hero banner and KPI cards for instant situational awareness. One of our best features is the Risk Slider: it allows administrators to calibrate what 'High Risk' means in real-time, instantly updating the high-risk patient roster and risk-distribution plots."

    Performance & Reliability: "To keep things snappy for busy doctors, we used st.cache_data. Even with 5,000 beds' worth of data, the dashboard loads instantly. And we haven't sacrificed quality for speed—our pytest suite ensures that every calculation, from occupancy rates to mortality trends, is mathematically sound."

    Strategic Impact: "By visualizing ICU rates, complication costs, and readmission risks, we give leadership the data they need to adjust staffing or refine treatment protocols. We’ve proven that you don't need a massive server farm to get world-class insights."

    The Wrap-up: "Moving forward, we are ready to scale. Whether it's connecting real-time data exports, integrating Tabular LLMs for deeper note analysis, or a containerized deployment, the foundation is solid. We invite you to explore the dashboard and let us know which new KPIs you’d like to see added next."
